Write a program that solves a linear equation ax = b in integers. Given two integers a and b (a may be zero), return a single integer value as a string if it exists and return “no solution” or “many solutions” otherwise.linear_eq(int, int) -&gt; str

linear_eq(int, int) -&gt; str

Example function calls:

&gt;&gt;&gt; linear_eq(1, -2)

‘-2’

&gt;&gt;&gt; linear_eq(2, -1)

‘no solution’

&gt;&gt;&gt; linear_eq(1, -2)

‘-2’

&gt;&gt;&gt; linear_eq(2, -1)

‘no solution’

Extra inforamtionThere are values for a and b where it does not matter what x is. The equation will always be satisfiedThere are vaules for a and b where x cannot be an integer
